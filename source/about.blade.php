    <p class="mb-6">I grew up in New Hampshire dreaming about being a politician and somehow ended up living in a small town in Illinois <a href="https://buildonline.io" >co-founding a software company</a> and pastoring <a href="https://biblebaptistmattoon.org">a small church.</a></p>

    <p class="mb-6">I met my wife while still a teenager and we've been <em>a thing</em> now for over twenty years (married for seventeen). Together we have five beautiful children, ranging from 13 to infant.</p>

    <p class="mb-6">I write on here mostly about church stuff (independent Baptist), but occasionally I'll talk about software development, politics, or whatever else I'm thinking about.  I plan on adding my sermon manuscripts eventually.</p>
