We are on the road heading home from Noah's Biopsy and lots of people are asking for an update and results so here you go.  

We were hoping that the biopsy would confirm that Noah had something called TINU Syndrome, which is a rare and fairly treatable condition Noah's symptoms seemed to point to.  Unfortunately, the biopsy did not confirm that diagnosis.  Here is what we learned:

## The Good News
The good news is that Noah has no active inflammation in his kidneys.  (This is what they were looking for to confirm TINU.)  Whatever is causing his issues, isn't currently active in his kidneys.

## The Bad News
The bad news is that 50% of the tissue they sampled was scarred and damaged.  Whatever Noah was going through did a number on his kidneys.  

## The Silver Lining
Based on the labs and the observation of the hospital, his kidneys seem to be functioning fairly well.  They believe his young body has adjusted and the damage is not extensive enough for him to need a kidney transplant or dialysis.  

## More Questions
I think the worst thing for us is we still don't know what is causing all of Noah's issues.  The doctors have ordered more tests and hinted at something even rarer than TINU.  For now, he's fine, and they are going to treat his symptoms and keep a watch on his kidneys.

They had him see a specialist pediatric dermatologist while in the hospital.  She has adjusted his medication and they are going to start seeing him there.  We are super happy with the doctors and nurses at Children's in St. Louis, but really wish it wasn't over two hours away.  We are going to be making a lot of trips there.  

What's the real estate market look like for AirBnB's in St. Louis?
